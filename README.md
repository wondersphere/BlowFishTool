# BlowFishTool
 Blowfish encryption / decryption tool

 This tool utilizes NSIS blowfish plugin created by yehiaeg (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Blowfish_plug-in). It was meant to be used with ConfigPC installer software at my work as the plugin seems to be using its own blowfish implementation, hence why this tool is also written using NSIS. But this tool can also be used for general usage in cases where the plugin mentioned is being used.   

The GUI is builf using NSIS Dialog Designer (http://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/nsisdialogdesigner). NSIS needs to be installed to be able to compile the .nsi file.
